the backup file on a backup medium, which can be a hard disk, shared network folder, USB flash drive, or even another computer on the network.
According to Gonzalez, you should create a system repair disc before backing up your data or system file. When a serious system error has occurred, a system repait disc can repair and restore your operating system to a working state.
When you back up your files, you can either let Windows decide what to backup or choose which files to back up by yourself. When Windows chooses the files, Windows will back up data files as well as important system files in a system image. Only choose to select the files yourself if you know exactly which files you need to recover in the event of a system failure.
Once you selected which files and folders you will back up your files—on an optical disc, a hard disk (internal or external), or a network location. You also can choose the frequency, day, and time the backups occur. It is recommended that you back up your files weekly. The first time you use the ‘Set up a backup’ wizard, you will be asked these questions, after which an initial backup will be created. The amount of time a backup takes to run depends upon the options you choose. It can take from a few minutes to one hour or more.
